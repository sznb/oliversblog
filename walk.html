           Sunday Walk

            <p>
            On Sunday my family and I went a on a walk/picnic with our friends the Wintrips. We hiked a pretty long loop- it was about 4.25 miles. We had our picnic about halfway through. It was really good. We had dinner rols with jam, cinnamon rolls, and salami. By the time the walk had ended we were very tired out.
